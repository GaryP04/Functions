# Functions Practice

## Functions

To begin, just as JavaScript, TypeScript functions can be created both as a named function or as an anonymous function. This allows you to choose the most appropriate approach for your application, whether you're building a list of functions in an API or a one-off function to hand off to another function.

To quickly recap what these two approaches look like in JavaScript:

// Named function
function add (x,  y) {
    return x + y;
}

// Anonymous function
let myAdd = function (x ,y) {
    return x+y;
};
